# zbMATH Open Knowledge Graph

We construct a large-scale, historically deep knowledge graph derived from [**zbMATH Open**](https://zbmath.org/), the world’s most comprehensive and historically rich mathematical database, covering scholarly work from 1763 to the present.

The resulting **zbMATH Knowledge Graph (KG)**, fully compliant with RDF and Semantic Web standards, interconnects publication metadata while leveraging the unique features of zbMATH:

- Expert-curated reviews
- High-quality author disambiguation
- Expert-assigned keywords and *Mathematics Subject Classification* (MSC), a fine-grained and historically stable ontology of mathematical subjects

This combination provides a rich semantic foundation for capturing the long-term evolution of mathematical knowledge, enabling advanced retrieval and reasoning beyond conventional citation-based bibliometric methods.

Through several **case studies**, we demonstrate the ability of the zbMATH KG to:

- Uncover **overlooked precursors** beyond traditional citation analysis
- Reveal **conceptual ancestry across fields**
- Trace **concept revivals** in new contexts
- Map **author–reviewer intellectual lineage**, illustrating how ideas propagate via scholarly interactions

These **historically-grounded retrieval** methods expose intellectual dynamics that conventional citation-based systems in scholarly domains often fail to capture.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧠 **RDF-Based Semantic Knowledge Graph**  
  Built entirely on RDF triples, the KG supports semantic interoperability and adheres to Linked Open Data standards, enabling rich, machine-readable knowledge representation.

- 🔍 **SPARQL Query Interface**  
  Provides a flexible SPARQL endpoint for executing complex queries that reveal deep, semantically enriched insights into mathematical scholarship.

- 📚 **Expert-Curated, High-Quality Mathematical Metadata**  
  Integrates richly annotated publications, disambiguated authors, expert reviews, keywords, and *Mathematics Subject Classification* (MSC) — a historically stable, fine-grained ontology — enabling nuanced exploration beyond citations.

- 🔄 **Robust Linked Data Integration**  
  Cross-links with authoritative external URL and identifiers (e.g., DOI), enhancing entity resolution and connecting the KG within the broader scholarly data ecosystem.

- 📈 **Historically-Grounded Intellectual Discovery**  
  Enables historically-grounded retrieval and long-range intellectual analysis, e.g., for uncovering overlooked precursors, tracing conceptual lineages and revivals, and mapping intellectual influence across disciplines.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- [`data/`](./data) – `.jsonl` raw data and `.ttl` RDF KG (subset), ontology files (`.ttl`), etc.
- [`front/`](./front) – Fuseki triple store setup for serving the RDF subset (example only — SPARQL endpoint runs on Virtuoso for scalability)
- [`src/`](./src) – Source code for data harvest, RDF KG construction, statistics calculation, etc.
- [`use-case/`](./use-case) – Use case-specific code, SPARQL queries, results, and visualizations
- [`run-convert.sh`](./run-convert.sh) – Shell script to convert raw data into RDF format
- [`README.md`](./README.md) – Project documentation
  
## 🏗️ Knowledge Graph Construction

### 🔧 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Java 8+ (for RDF libraries Apache Jena)
- RDF triple store. Here we use [Apache Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) as example for its simplicity, (example only — production SPARQL endpoint runs on Virtuoso for scalability)
- `pip` for Python dependency management

### 🛠️ Data Harvesting

```bash
python harvest-by-id.py 
```

### 🛠️ RDF Construction

```bash
run-convert.sh #or,
python create_rdf.py 
```


### 🛠️ RDF Triple Store setup

```bash
to be added
```
