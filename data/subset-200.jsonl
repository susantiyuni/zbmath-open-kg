A uniformly valid composite solution that applies everywhere in the linear and nonlinear regions can then be obtained in one of the usual ways.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0787.00033]."], "review_type": ["review"], "reviewer": ["None"], "reviewer_id": ["None"], "serial": [null], "serial_publisher": ["None"], "serial_title": ["None"], "rights": ["Content generated by zbMATH Open, such as reviews,\n    classifications, software, or author disambiguation data,\n    are distributed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

Such games have many important properties, including the fact that they have a non-empty core, i.e., there exists a cost allocation \\(x_ i\\) for which no money is lost (i.e., \\(\\sum_{i\\in N} x_ i= c(N))\\), and for which no coalition \\(S\\) can object to it, because according to this cost allocation, the cost for this coalition \\(S\\) is not greater than if it would cost this coalition to start the venture on its own (i.e., \\(\\sum_{i\\in S} x_ i\\leq c(S))\\). In the paper under review, a natural generalization of this notion is proposed and analyzed. Namely, in some situations, coalitions that are strong enough have a certain advantage. E.g., if a car pool is defined as at least 3 people in a car, then coalitions of 3 players immediately have an advantage in a car-pooling game, while further increase in the coalition (to 4 or more) does not change much. In general, a game is called \\(k\\)-concave if the above ``concavity'' inequality is true for \\(| T|< k-1\\); for \\(| T|= k-1\\), \\(c(S\\cup\\{i\\})- c(S)\\geq c(N)- c(T)>0\\) (i.e., additional increase in cost from \\(T\\) to \\(N\\) is practically negligible), and \\(c(N)< c(S)\\) if \\(| S|\\geq k\\) and \\(S\\neq N\\) (i.e., coalitions with \\(k\\) or more players make no sense, unless this coalition includes everyone). For such games, the core also turns out to be non-empty. Moreover, these games admit the following interesting characterization: Let's fix an ordering of the players, and, starting from the first player, and the players one by one (following the fixed order). To players \\(1,2,\\dots,k- 1\\) in this ordering, we allocate a cost that its addition brings to the venture. \\(k\\)th player gets the different between \\(c(N)\\) and what was before him, and all other players get nothing (this allocation is similar to the ones that are used in the definition of a Shapley value: namely, the Shapley value is the arithmetic average of similar allocations over all possible permutations). It turns out that the game is \\(k\\)-concave iff for each permutation, the resulting allocation belongs to the core. Two other examples of \\(k\\)-concave games are given: the airport game and the location game.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0788.00061]."], "review_type": ["review"], "reviewer": ["5423"], "reviewer_id": ["kosheleva.olga-m"], "serial": [null], "serial_publisher": ["None"], "serial_title": ["None"], "rights": ["Content generated by zbMATH Open, such as reviews,\n    classifications, software, or author disambiguation data,\n    are distributed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

The modified Lemaître approach concerns forming processes which accompany finite inelastic strains and notable damage accumulation. The Gurson model deals with the description of void nucleation and growth within porous ductile materials. \n\n\nThe elastic response is formulated in terms of spatial elastic logarithmic Hencky strains and employs the flow rule for finite elastoplasticity. The novel aspect of the ``geometrically exact'' approach pursued in this work is the lack of approximations in the geometrical description of multiplicative elastoplastic deformations. This framework allows to integrate the flow rule and the evolution equations for the internal variables with the same algorithms as in the infinesimal elastoplasticity. \n\n\nExponential map stress integrators in various modifications are developed and applied. The constitutive equations are derived from Clausius-Duhem inequality and the postulate of maximum dissipation. Different proposals concern the correct choice of the arguments of the Helmholtz free energy. This discussion cumulates in the dependence of the Helmholtz free energy on the elastic Finger tensor and the spatial metric to express the assumed isotropy. \n\n\nDetails pertaining to the integration algorithm for two models together with the linearization necessary for the global Newton-Raphson strategy are given. Standard examples within finite elastoplasticity are examined, and the results of two damage models are compared with the predictions of the von Mises model. Both damage formulations tend to increase the softening behaviour of the material with respect to the von Mises formulation. \n\n\nThe main outcome of this study is the dramatic influence of damage evolution on the postpeak behaviour in necking and localization problems. It is shown that the Gurson model reduces the initial yield strength due to the existence of an initial void volume fraction. An essential difference between two formulations is the behaviour in compression. Due to the dissipative character of damage evolution within the Lemaître model, damage increases in tension as well as in compression. In the same time the damage evolution of the Gurson model is derived from the balance of mass; the void volume fraction decreases in compression which leads to damage healing."], "review_type": ["review"], "reviewer": ["7463"], "reviewer_id": ["parinov.ivan-a"], "serial": [null], "serial_publisher": ["Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg"], "serial_title": ["Computational Mechanics"], "references": [null], "reference": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null], "text": ["Chaboche, J.

In this development, a so-called ``internally-reducible'' condition to characterize a class of robust servomechanism controllers is derived first, then the proposed controller is shown to be contained in this class. Generally speaking, a sampled- data structure using exponential hold can provide more design freedoms so that it tends to simplify the construction of a robust servomechanism controller and facilitate the implementation on digital computers.

However, the classical ADI iteration is not directly applicable to finite element (FE) matrices, as it tends to converge too slowly for 3-D problems, and as the selection of adequate acceleration parameters, remains a difficult task. In this paper we propose a block- ADI approach, which overcomes some of these problems. In particular we derive a simple inexpensive heuristic for selecting the acceleration parameters. The new approach can be viewed as a combination of the classical ADI method and a domain decomposition approach.\n\nFor the entire collection see [Zbl 0788.00064]."], "review_type": ["summary"], "reviewer": ["None"], "reviewer_id": ["None"], "serial": [null], "serial_publisher": ["None"], "serial_title": ["None"], "rights": ["Content generated by zbMATH Open, such as reviews,\n    classifications, software, or author disambiguation data,\n    are distributed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

Many beautiful geometric results were discovered in the past by classical geometers and continue to be discovered (and rediscovered) presently. A new point of view at the subject, connected with the much younger soliton theory, provided an extremely useful framework in which such families of surfaces can be identified with families of solutions to associated nonlinear equations, for which new solutions can be generated from the ones that are already known. Furthermore, the procedure(s) for this process can be described analytically and effectively, and new solutions (surfaces) can be numerically computed.\n\n\nIn this article the author surveys eight families of surfaces (most of them were known to classical geometers) and describes in detail the corresponding integrable equations from the point of view of soliton theory. The survey contains many results, new as well as already known.

In the first part of the paper the author proposes an essentially conservative second-order scheme, proving that it satisfies the so called total variation bounded (TVB) property.

Comput. 45, 15-21 (1985; Zbl 0592.65058)] which restricts severely the order of convergence of the schemes.\n\n\nFor the scalar conservation law, a detailed theoretical study is carried out in Section 2. Next, the author extends the result of the scalar case to systems of conservation laws by using some kind of averaging, such as \\textit{P. L. Roe's} averaging [J. Comput. Phys. 43, 357-372 (1981; Zbl 0474.65066)]. Again a second-order essentially conservative scheme is proposed.\n\n\nIn the last section the numerical results obtained by solving numerically several problems with the proposed schemes are presented. As scalar problems a linear equation with periodic initial conditions and a shock wave problem for the inviscid Burgers' equation are considered. As systems of equations, Euler's equations of gas dynamics with discontinuous initial values are considered (here an artificial compression technique is introduced in order to improve the resolution of shock waves).

Assume that the conductor of \\(E/ \\mathbb{Q}\\) is an odd integer \\(N\\) and, in addition, that \\(E\\) satisfies the Shimura-Taniyama- Weil conjecture for its \\(L\\)-series.\n\n\nThe present paper provides a survey on the arithmetic of those elliptic curves \\(E/ \\mathbb{Q}\\) (of the above type) which also satisfy the so-called Heegner hypothesis.

The algorithm presented in this paper processes images in predetermined order, which means that the processing order depends only on the image representation scheme and not on specific properties of the image. The algorithm handles a wide variety of image representation schemes (rasters, run lengths, quadtrees, bintrees, etc.). How to adapt the standard UNION-FIND algorithm to permit reuse of temporary labels is shown. This is done using a technique called age balancing, in which, when two labels are merged, the older label becomes the father of the younger label. This technique can be made to coexist with the more conventional rule of weight balancing, in which the label with more descendants becomes the father of the label with fewer descendants. Various image scanning orders are examined and classified. It is also shown that when the algorithm is specialized to a pixel array scanned in raster order, the total processing time is linear in the number of pixels. The linear-time processing time follows from a special property of the UNION-FIND algorithm, which may be of independent interest. This property states that under certain restrictions on the input, UNION-FIND runs in time linear in the number of FIND and UNION operations. Under these restrictions, linear-time performance can be achieved without resorting to the more complicated Gabow-Tarjan algorithm for disjoint set union."], "review_type": ["summary"], "reviewer": ["None"], "reviewer_id": ["None"], "serial": [null], "serial_publisher": ["Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), New York, NY"], "serial_title": ["Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery"], "rights": ["Content generated by zbMATH Open, such as reviews,\n    classifications, software, or author disambiguation data,\n    are distributed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

A main result is that if \\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi'\\) are two cusp forms on \\(GL(2)\\), an \\(L\\)-function attached to \\(\\text{Ad}^3 (\\pi) \\times \\pi'\\) extends to a meromorphic function on \\(C\\) satisfying a standard functional equation. Here \\(\\text{Ad}^3 (\\pi)i\\) is the adjoint cube of \\(\\pi\\). This result gives us further evidence for the existence of symmetric cube of a cusp form on \\(GL(2)\\). \n\n\nAnother main result is that the fourth symmetric power \\(L\\)-function attached to an arbitrary non-monomial cusp form \\(GL(2)\\) over any number field with non-trivial central character is holomorphic and non-zero on the half plane \\(\\text{Re} (s)\\geq 1\\). \n\n\nAs an appendix the paper contains a letter of January 24, 1992 from \\textit{Jean-Pierre Serre} to the author in which results on asymptotic distribution of Hecke eigenvalues of modular cusp forms are proved.

Since the early 1940's, when \\textit{S. Eilenberg}, \\textit{S. MacLane}, and others discovered that the formalism of (co-)homology in topology could be axiomatized, and conveyed to more general algebraic systems, the development of abstract ``homological'' methods has undergone a rapid expansion, touching almost every area of algebra, geometry and topology.\n\n\nThe first systematic account on homological algebra (as a now self- reliant, mature algebraic theory) was provided by the epoch-making textbook of \\textit{H. Cartan} and \\textit{S. Eilenberg}, published in 1956, which substantially influenced the further development of the subject itself as well as its increasingly far-reaching applications in other branches of mathematics. As homological methods gained in significance, applications and popularity, other textbooks successively appeared on the subject, partially reflecting the further progress made in the meantime, on the one hand, and casually trying to make the topic more accessible (on a comparatively elementary level) to non-specialists, on the other hand.\n\n\nAmong the most frequently used ones, apart from the pioneering work of Cartan and Eilenberg [cf. \\textit{H. Cartan} and \\textit{S. Eilenberg}, Homological Algebra. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press (1956; Zbl 0075.24305)], are the well-known texts by \\textit{D.

Paris: Masson (1980; Zbl 0455.18010)].\n\n\nDuring that period, from 1955 to the early 1980's, the development of homological algebra and its applications proceeded likewise tempestously. Largely due to the influence of \\textit{A. Grothendieck}, \\textit{J.-P. Serre}, and their French school of algebraic geometry, homological algebra has been increasingly formulated in the general terms of Abelian categories and derived functors. This provided the necessary framework for the rigorous foundation of modern algebraic geometry by the theory of schemes and their morphisms, sheaves and their cohomology, local cohomology, and other central notions. Related areas, such as commutative algebra, algebraic topology, algebraic number theory, and algebraic analysis were just as influenced, for instance by homological concepts like spectral sequences, group cohomology, Galois cohomology, Hochschild homology, André-Quillen homology, cyclic homology, triangulated categories, derived categories, \\({\\mathcal D}\\)-modules in microanalysis, etc. Thus the landscape of homological algebra has evolved tremendously since the appearance of the most standard texts.\n\n\nIn these days, homological algebra is a fundamental tool, of obviously still increasing importance, for mathematicians and (nowadays also) theoretical physicists. It represents a basic framework for relating local and global properties of algebraic, geometric, or topological objects, proving non-constructive existence theorems, investigating obstructions to carrying out various kinds of constructions, and serves as a well-established common language in most fields of pure mathematics. Unfortunately, many of the later developments in homological algebra are, of course, not contained in the earlier standard texts and, what is more, also not easily found in the vast original literature. This meanwhile cumbersome situation certainly requires a new text that provides a comprehensive and unified account of homological algebra at its present state of art, and which helps to break down the increasing barrier between active researchers and casual users.\n\n\nThe present book is a rewarding attempt to take this requirement into account. The contents are arranged in such a way that the first half of the book covers the canonical (or classical) topics in homological algebra, as they are also found in most of the earlier standard texts, whereas the second half is devoted to the more recent developments mentioned above. Concretely, the text is subdivided into ten chapters consisting of several sections each, and an appendix providing some basic material from category theory.\n\n\nChapter I gives an introduction to chain complexes and the basic operations on them, including a generalization to complexes in Abelian categories.\n\n\nChapter II introduces derived functors and delta-functors, following Grothendieck's original approach via projective and injective resolutions. Along this line, the concept of sheaf cohomology for topological spaces is briefly sketched as an application. This chapter concludes with adjoint functors, Tor and Ext, and exactness properties of functors. The discussion of balancing the functors Ext and Tor is particularly nice and uses a new, elegant approach.\n\n\nChapter III deals with the standard material on Ext and Tor. In addition, the author discusses the derived functor \\(\\lim^1\\) of the inverse limit of modules, the Künneth formulas, the universal coefficient theorems, and their applications to algebraic topology.\n\n\nChapter IV is devoted to the homology theory of rings, including homological dimension theory, rings of small dimension, local rings, Koszul complexes, and the basics of local cohomology ``à la Grothendieck''.\n\n\nChapter V provides an introduction to spectral sequences. In contrast to the other textbooks, where spectral sequences are usually introduced at the end of the book, and therefore actually never applied, they are here discussed early enough to be able to utilize them as a fundamental tool in the following chapters.\n\n\nAs to the algebraic aspects of spectral sequences, most of the material can be already found in the book of Cartan and Eilenberg. However, the author simultaneously spends much effort at illustrating their computational power, too, mainly by discussing some of the most important topological applications (e.g., the significance of the Leray-Serre spectral sequence in algebraic topology). Another feature is provided by the fact that, for the first time, several results on the convergence properties of spectral sequences are covered, which are difficult to find somewhere else but widely used by topologists.\n\n\nAfter that, homology and cohomology of groups is discussed in Chapter VI. The material covered here is basically the canonical one, yet the presentation is exceptionally elegant and unifying. In particular, there are extra sections on the Lyndon/Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence (as a special case of the Grothendieck spectral sequence), covering spaces and classifying spaces in topology, universal central extensions of groups, and Galois cohomology (including profinite groups and Brauer groups).\n\n\nAnother illustration of the homological methods developed so far is given in Chapter VII which explains Lie algebra (co-)homology. The first few sections provide a fairly self-contained introduction to Lie algebras, modules over Lie algebras and universal enveloping algebras, whereas the following sections deal with the classical cohomology theory of Lie algebras initiated in 1948 by \\textit{C. Chevalley} and \\textit{S. Eilenberg}, with special emphasis on universal central extensions and affine Lie algebras. The latter topics are essentially taken from the more recent work of \\textit{R. Wilson} [Euclidean Lie algebras are universal central extensions, Lect. Notes Math. 933, 210--213 (1982; Zbl 0498.17012)].\n\n\nThe following chapters turn to modern developments in homological algebra. Chapter VIII concerns simplicial methods, and that both from the classical and from the modern point of view. This includes discussions on simplicial objects in categories, simplicial homotopy groups, the Dold-Kan correspondence, the Eilenberg-Zilber theorem, canonical resolutions, cotriple homology resolutions, and a short outline of the recent André-Quillen (co-)homology theory in ``homotopical algebra''.\n\n\nChapter IX gives an introduction to Hochschild (co-)homology and cyclic homology, together with some of their applications. The material on Hochschild (co-)homology and cohomology of algebras is partly classical, and already contained in \\textit{S. MacLane}'s book ``Homology'' (cited above), on the other hand enriched by more recent relationships to derivations, algebraic differentials, and smooth algebras, following Grothendieck's approach in ``EGA IV'' [\\textit{A. Grothendieck} and \\textit{J. Dieudonné}, Éléments de géométrie algébrique, Part IV, Publ. Math., Inst. Hautes Etud. Sci. 20 (1964; Zbl 0136.15901), ibid. 24 (1965; Zbl 0135.39701), ibid. 28 (1966; Zbl 0144.19904), ibid. 32 (1967; Zbl 0153.22301)].\n\n\nThe discussion of cyclic homology is rather new in the textbook literature, and essentially based on the original papers by \\textit{A. Connes} [Cohomologie cyclique et foncteurs \\(\\text{Ext}^ n\\), C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Sér. I 296, 953-958 (1983; Zbl 0534.18009)], \\textit{J.-L. Loday} and \\textit{D. Quillen} [Cyclic homology and the Lie algebra homology of matrices, Comment. Math. Helv. 59, 565--591 (1984; Zbl 0565.17006)], and \\textit{T. Goodwillie} [Cyclic homology, derivations, and the free loop space, Topology 24, 187--215 (1985; Zbl 0569.16021)]. Comprehensive textbooks on this subject are just appearing, e.g., \\textit{J.-L. Loday}'s book ``Cyclic homology'' [Berlin: Springer-Verlag (1992; Zbl 0780.18009)] and the forthcoming book by \\textit{D. Husemoller} and \\textit{C. Kassel} (``Cyclic homology'', book in preparation).\n\n\nThe concluding Chapter X is devoted to the concept of the derived category of an Abelian category. This encompasses the algebraic aspects, as they have been developed by \\textit{J.-L. Verdier} in ``SGA \\(4{1\\over 2}\\)'' [Lect. Notes Math. 569, 262--311 (1977; Zbl 0407.18008)] and \\textit{R. Hartshorne} [Residues and duality, Lect. Notes Math. 20 (1966; Zbl 0212.26101)], as well as the topological counterpart in stable homotopy theory [\\textit{L. G. Lewis}, \\textit{J. P. May} and \\textit{M. Steinberger}, Equivariant stable homotopy theory, Lect. Notes Math. 1213 (1986; Zbl 0611.55001)]. Another good reference for derived categories, not cited in the present book, is the recent (Russian) text ``Methods of homological algebra, Vol. I'' by \\textit{S. I. Gel'fand} and \\textit{Yu. I. Manin} [Nauka, Moskva (1988; Zbl 0668.18001)]. Their approach to homological algebra is entirely centered on the notion of derived category, from the very beginning on, and therefore completely different from any other text on homological algebra, including the present one.\n\n\nAltogether, and as already mentioned above, the present textbook is a highly welcome addition to the existing standard literature on homological algebra, particularly valuable with regard to the well-arranged, methodically unified compound of both the indispensable traditional techniques and some of the most important recent parts of the modern homological toolkit. The many intermingled special topics from various areas in mathematics, among them the historically distinguished topological aspects and applications, endow this text with an extraordinary width and versatility. As prerequisites, only the basic knowledge from an introductory graduate algebra course is assumed; all the notions from higher category theory utilized in this book are summarized in the appendix. Numerous examples and exercises scattered in the text furnish the reader with a plenty of further motivations and hints.\n\n\nThus the present book on homological algebra represents both an introductory, self-contained text suitable for graduate students and a very useful, up-to-date reference book for working mathematicians (and physicists) using homological methods."], "review_type": ["review"], "reviewer": ["875"], "reviewer_id": ["kleinert.werner"], "serial": [null], "serial_publisher": ["Cambridge University Press, Cambridge"], "serial_title": ["Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics"], "rights": ["Content generated by zbMATH Open, such as reviews,\n    classifications, software, or author disambiguation data,\n    are distributed under CC-BY-SA 4.0.

However, the first part of the Chapter 1 gives brief summary of VDM for those readers whose experience lies elsewhere. The remainder of Chapter 1 provides an overview of the logical framework on which the material of the rest of the book is based.\n\n\nLike other formal specification languages, VDM-SL provides an underlying logic and a collection of primitive types (e.g. numbers, truth values) and type constructors (e.g. sets, lists) out of which specifications are built. Proofs about a particular specification will therefore involve, at least in part, reasoning about these built-in primitives, the properties of which are defined via a collection of axioms. Part I (Chapters 2 to 9) gives axioms and definitions for the basic VDM logic, data types and type constructors, and discusses how such axiomatisations can be designed, as well as problems which might be encountered. It also shows how theories of useful results about these constructs can be built up by proof. These chapters introduce important proof strategies, such as induction, case distinction, and the technique of structuring proofs by using subsidiary lemmas. They also demonstrate the use of informal argument as a tool, both for determining whether a particular result is provable and for determining the outline structure of a more rigorous or formal proof. These points are illustrated with the help of detailed worked examples, with explanations of the key stages in the production of a proof and of the arguments used to determine the best strategy for its construction.\n\n\nHaving developed a collection of useful results about the primitive constructs of the specification language, the next stage is to use these in proving properties of a specification or a refinement step. This is the subject of Part II (Chapters 10 to 13). Chapter 10 shows how to construct a theory from a specification, including the axioms describing the essential properties of the specification and the proof obligations representing properties that the specification must possess if it is to be considered sound. Chapter 11 extends these ideas to reasoning about refinements. The techniques discussed so far are illustrated in Chapter 12, which contains a substantial case study of an air-traffic control subsystem, including an abstract specification and two levels of refinement. The case study also shows how validation conditions can be used to discover errors in a specification and to help to demonstrate that a specification actually exhibits the required safety properties.

According to the first named author's monograph [Lattice points (1988; Zbl 0675.10031)], one has an asymptotic representation \n\\[\nR_{k,n} (x)= V_{k,n} x^{n/k}+ \\sum_{r=1}^{n-1} H_{k,n, r} (x)+ \\Delta_{k,n} (x), \\tag{1}\n\\]\n where \\(V_{k,n} x^{n/k}\\) is the volume of the domain in question, \\(\\Delta_{k,n} (x)\\) is an error term and the functions \\(H_{k,n,r} (x)\\) are defined in terms of integral representations involving \\(\\Delta_{k,r} (x)\\). In order to get sharp estimates for the remainder terms in (1), it is of interest to have at hand precise bounds for \\(\\int_ 0^ x \\Delta_{k,r} (t) dt\\). In this direction, the main achievement of the present paper is the result \n\\[\n\\int_ 0^ x \\Delta_{k,3} (t) dt\\ll x\\log x. \\tag{2}\n\\]\n This is established by most tricky arguments involving the theory of two- dimensional exponential sums. Combining (2) with a corresponding known bound for the case \\(r=2\\), the authors obtain significantly improved estimates for the functions \\(H_{k,n,r} (x)\\). \n\n\nFor a part, these are capable of further slight refinements, if one incorporates the results of \\textit{M.

By assuming a displacement field which allows a nonlinear variation of the in-plane displacements through the laminate thickness, the geometric and stress continuity conditions at the interfaces between two adjacent layeres are fulfilled a priori.\n\n\nIn the present paper the authors extend this approach to the laminated composite anisotropic shells. The paper contains: the equations of motion and related boundary conditions of multilayered anisotropic shells derived by using the dynamical version of the principle of virtual work based on the assumed piecewise cubic displacement field; some results on bending under sinusoidal transverse loading, undamped frequencies for symmetrically laminated cross-ply rectangular and square plates simply supported on all edges to show accuracy of the proposed model; a comparison with results from three-dimensional elasticity and other approximate two-dimensional models.\n\n\nThe following conclusions have been drawn: the proposed approach preserves all the advantages of the high-order shear deformation theory and gives very accurate results also for low plate thickness ratio and relative high values of the elastic moduli, and does not require any arbitrary shear correction factor. The fulfilment of the transverse shearing stresses continuity conditions on the interfaces improves not only the prediction of the thickness distribution of the transverse shearing stresses, but also the prediction of the thickness distributions of the in-plane response (in-plane displacements and stresses) and of the global response (deflection, frequencies and buckling loads)."], "review_type": ["review"], "reviewer": ["5922"], "reviewer_id": ["baczynski.zbigniew-f"], "serial": [null], "serial_publisher": ["Springer Netherlands, Dordrecht"], "serial_title": ["Meccanica"], "references": [null], "reference": [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null], "text": ["Bert, C.W., ?A critical evaluation of new plate theories applied to laminated composites?,Comp.
