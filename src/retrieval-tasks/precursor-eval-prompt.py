Act as a mathematician evaluating academic influence and conceptual alignment. You are given a list of 45 potential precursor papers. Your task is to evaluate whether each one represents:

- A contribution that played a formative role in the development of the target paper,
- A hidden influence,
- Or a conceptually aligned work that was not cited.

**Target paper**: "Modular d0-algebras"  
URL: https://zbmath.org/1464.06015

Please evaluate each precursor using the following scoring system:

Score | Meaning  
----- | -------  
5 | Very likely a formative or conceptually aligned precursor (core structure or ideas)  
4 | Likely relevant and possibly influential or conceptually aligned  
3 | Some structural or topical overlap but weaker relevance  
2 | Peripheral relation; topic overlap but unlikely to contribute  
1 | Very unlikely to be formative or aligned; minimal or no structural relevance  

Given the following list of papers:

{list_paper}

**Instructions**:
- For each paper, provide a score (1–5).
- Optionally include a brief justification (1–2 sentences) explaining the reasoning behind the score.
- Focus on conceptual and structural relevance to the target paper, not just surface-level keyword overlap.
